# Music Store Database Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a Music Store Database using SQL queries to extract insights and uncover trends related to music sales, customer behaviors, and artist popularity. The analysis is implemented through a series of SQL queries each designed to address specific questions related to the business operations of a hypothetical music store.

## Repository Structure
```
- SQL data analysis.sql      - Contains all the SQL queries used to perform the database analysis
- Music Store database.sql   - Contains data used is analysis
- Music database schema.png  - Can be used to understand data
```

## Queries and Analysis
This analysis covers a range of queries to explore different aspects of the database:
1. **Senior-most Employee:** Identifies the most senior employee based on job title.
2. **Top Countries by Invoices:** Lists countries generating the most invoices.
3. **Top Invoice Values:** Finds the top three values of total invoices.
4. **City with Highest Sales:** Searches for the city with the highest sum of invoice totals.
5. **Best Customer:** Determines the customer who has spent the most money.
6. **Rock Music Listeners:** Lists all customers who prefer Rock music.
7. **Top Rock Artists:** Identifies the top 10 rock artists by track counts.
8. **Long Track List:** Compiles tracks longer than the average track length.
9. **Spending by Customer on Artists:** Calculates total spending by each customer on artists.
10. **Popular Music Genre by Country:** Identifies the most popular music genre in each country.
11. **Top Spenders by Country:** Shows the top spender in each country.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a SQL-compatible database management system (DBMS) installed, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, to run the queries contained in the SQL file.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/Harshit0699/MUSIC-STORE-DATAB...
```
2. Open your DBMS and create a connection to your database server.
3. Import the Music Store Database to your DBMS (Database file not included in this repository).
4. Open the `SQL data analysis.sql` file and run the queries in your DBMS to see the results.
